FaultTree.widget
================

This R package is used to augment the FaultTree package on R by enabling
creation of the graphical output as an htmlwidget. The widget object (produced
by ftree2widget) will display in the RStudio viewer pane and seamlessly embed
within [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents
and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web applications. Alternatively it may be
saved as a standalone web page.

FaultTree.widget versions will match the underlying FaultTree package version
with which it was synchronized.
