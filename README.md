FaultTree.widget
================

fault tree back office prototype

This R package is used to augment the FaultTree package by enabling creation of
the graphical output as an htmlwidget. The widget will display in the RStudio
viewer pane. Alternatively it may be displayed in a browser without internet
connection, because the d3 javascript library is stored locally in the
FaultTree.widget library.

 

FaultTree.widget versions will match the underlying FaultTree package version
with which it was synchronized.
